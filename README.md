# Adjustable-Resolution Neural Style Transfer and Depth Mapping Realtime Video Feedback

## Overview

This repository contains code for live video NST and depth mapping at adjustable resolutions. It includes:
- **High-resolution video processing** for both foreground and background.
- **Low-resolution video processing** for both foreground and background.
- **Demo application** to dynamically adjust video feedback resolution through a simple user interface.

## Features

- **`test.py`**: Processes video with high-resolution for both the foreground and background.
- **`demo/app.py`**: A user-friendly interface to adjust and generate NST & DM video feedback with dynamic resolution changes.
